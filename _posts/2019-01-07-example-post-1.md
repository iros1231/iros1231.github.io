Most machine learning algorithms are fulfilled with mathematical things such as statistics, algebra, calculus and etc. They expect the data to be numerical such as a 2-dimensional array with rows as instances and columns as features. The problem with natural language is that the data is in the form of raw text, so that the text needs to be transformed into a vector. The process of transforming text into a vector is commonly referred to as text vectorization. Itâ€™s a fundamental process in natural language processing because none of the machine learning algorithms understand a text, not even computers. Text vectorization algorithm namely TF-IDF vectorizer, which is a very popular approach for traditional machine learning algorithms can help in transforming text into vectors.

### TF-IDF
Term frequency-inverse document frequency is a text vectorizer that transforms the text into a usable vector. It combines 2 concepts, Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF).
