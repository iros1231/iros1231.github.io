<!-- ### TF-IDF
Term frequency-inverse document frequency is a text vectorizer that transforms the text into a usable vector. It combines 2 concepts, Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF).

The term frequency is the number of occurrences of a specific term in a document. Term frequency indicates how important a specific term in a document. Term frequency represents every text from the data as a matrix whose rows are the number of documents and columns are the number of distinct terms throughout all documents.
Document frequency is the number of documents containing a specific term. Document frequency indicates how common the term is.

Inverse document frequency (IDF) is the weight of a term, it aims to reduce the weight of a term if the term’s occurrences are scattered throughout all the documents. IDF can be calculated as follow:
Inline equation: ${idf}_i=\log(\frac{}{})$ -->]]></content><author><name>Duar</name></author><category term="duar" /><category term="medicine" /><category term="big data" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most machine learning algorithms are fulfilled with mathematical things such as statistics, algebra, calculus and etc. They expect the data to be numerical such as a 2-dimensional array with rows as instances and columns as features.
